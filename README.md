# <Refactoring for Accessibility>


## Description
Code Refactoring is necessary to simplify and clarify HTML and CSS to make it easier to read and if necessary, modify or add to. Accessibility modifications make code easier to use by users with visual impairments. This refactoring was primarily concerned with taking an existing functional webpage and making the tags more semantic and more easily read by a screen reader. As a marketing agency, the user of this product wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines.
